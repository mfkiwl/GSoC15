-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program locates all the satellites that could be tuned in by the 
receiver.

It sets up the logging system, creates a ControlThread object,
makes it run, and releases memory back when the main thread has ended.

The gathered information can be used for auto-configuration of receiver.
