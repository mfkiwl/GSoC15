This program locates all the satellites that could be tuned in by the receiver.

It sets up the logging system, creates a ControlThread object, makes it run, 
and releases memory back when the main thread has ended.

The gathered information can be used for auto-configuration of receiver.

This program also separates out different metadata formats into .xml files.
